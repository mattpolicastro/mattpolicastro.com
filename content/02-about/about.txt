Text: In 2013, I graduated from The College of Wooster where I studied Sociology and Environmental Science. Along the way, I conducted my [senior thesis](http://www.wooster.edu/academics/research/is/) â€” an exploration of the smartphone as sociological artifact.

While at Wooster I also began designing posters, campaigns, and all kinds of cool stuff. Now I get to design full-time. It's great.

These days, I am living and working in Cincinnati. If you think you'd like to work with me, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:matt@mattpolicastro.com).

I'm not on Twitter as much as I used to be, but it's still plenty. [Come say hi.](https://twitter.com/mattpolicastro)

I also like to ride bikes. [A lot.](http://www.strava.com/athletes/122205)

Finally, I have a [Tumblr](http://mattpolicastro.tumblr.com/). It's pretty dumb, but I like it at least.
