<p>After getting the first version of the site up, I was already unhappy. While not terrible, it was very much the product of my early lessons in Sass and Bourbon. And of course, life intervened and I had to put down development for longer than I would have liked.</p>
<p>So, a week ago, I finally cleared my docket and threw myself back into the mix. This redesign is the happy result. I'm still chewing through my portfolio — obscenely high standards notwithstanding — but hope to share some of it in the very near future. And, I'm happy to say that I'm ready to announce a few other irons in the fire.</p>
<h3 id="comingsoonish">Coming Soon(-ish)</h3>
<p>With a wholesale redesign of the site, I'm very behind. Some updates on what I announced last post:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standards-compliant code.</strong> I rewrote a ton of PHP and Sass for the redesign, and it is <em>dirty</em>. I'll be validating everything and optimising a ton of the final code.</li>
<li><strong>Open-sourced code.</strong> I still don't grok git. Advice and pointers are welcome. As for hosting the code: given relatively recent events, I'm not wild about GitHub. Suggestions for alternatives are also welcome.</li>
<li><strong>CSS transitions and animations.</strong> Though these were shelved for this redesign, I already have plans for various progressive enhancements.</li>
<li><strong>Portfolio.</strong> It's real. It exists. And it's coming very, very soon. Promise.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, as I mentioned above, I have a few new ideas I wanted to get out in the open:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic homepage.</strong> A few designer-types have said some very clever things about hosting your own presence and data online, and have given animus to a few ideas. I'm still in the early-thinking stage, but hope to be showing off something in the next few months.</li>
<li><strong>Directory of stuff I like.</strong> This has been rattling around in my head for a long time. I always loved things like the Whole Earth Catalog and Kevin Kelly's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://kk.org/cooltools/">Cool Tools</a>, and the past few years have seen a serious upswing in curation/recommendation websites (e.g. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://thewirecutter.com">The Wirecutter</a>). While I don't intend to launch a reviews site, I've always wanted the space to wax poetic about my favourite widgets and media.</li>
</ul>
<p>With luck, I'll have more cool stuff to show you soon. See you on the other side.</p>
