<p>Instead, I'd like to talk about super glue. I've taken up a lot of small hobbies to stay sane while I spend the most of my time working from home in Chicago's winter. And, through the course of those hobbies, I have come to understand the sublime heights and direst depths of fast-curing adhesivesâ€”and this week I may have found true love.</p>

This is an impossibly small improvement on my immediate circumstances yet it is an improvement nonetheless.</p>
