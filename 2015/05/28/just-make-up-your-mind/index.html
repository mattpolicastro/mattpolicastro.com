<p>Despite this being a busy spring and whatnot, the anxiety I’ve felt about blogging has largely evaporated: I’ve built myself a platform I enjoy using. But with the brouhaha about Facebook’s Instant Articles, it sure seems like a lot has changed <em>very</em> quickly.</p>
<p>Before, <a href="http://www.mattpolicastro.com/posts/fun">I’d mentioned that I had reservations</a> about Meteor and those have born fruit. Much was squawked from on high with regards to the Future of Journalism™ when Instant Articles launched, but I’ve been much more interested in the meta-narrative about the web itself. Peter-Paul Koch and John Gruber brought me to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instant Articles aren’t just a control play by Facebook—they’re a reaction to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/05/facebook_instant_articles">god-awful-slow sites.</a></li>
<li>How’d the web get this slow? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/tools_dont_solv.html">Developers are lazy.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Which is a long way of saying that I think I made the wrong bet. Now, don’t get me wrong—this is anything but an indictment of Meteor. I still love it. I’m still going to use it for data, work projects, and authoring here. But for an admittedly low-rent blog, it’s overkill. Fully-featured web apps have have a time and a place, but the web doesn’t need to pretend to be a native app. It should do what it’s best at: being the web.</p>
<p>So, I’m putting myself on blast and making some changes. Honestly not sure what to do yet. Meteor was a great ass-backwards introduction to Node, and all the modern programming features being added in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features">ES6</a> are mighty tempting. But it’ll probably be something rendered on the server and sent as plain-jane HTML, with plenty of room for accessibility, performance, and whatever else comes to mind.</p>
<p>It won’t be perfect.</p>
<p>But it’ll the web.</p>
