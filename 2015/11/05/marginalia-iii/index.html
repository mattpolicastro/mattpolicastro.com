Haven't been up to too much other than computer things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing some interesting analyses at work (modelling charitable giving). I'm definitely at a point where my analytical problem-solving feels R-shaped, but I've also been getting over my gripes with Python. Different jobs, different tools, and teaching/collaborating is fun.</li>
<li>Speaking of Python, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-agate/">agate</a> is phenomenal. It really does cut out a lot of the unfriendliness it comes to basic analysis in Python. Convinced a few of my colleagues who were really pushing the limits of Excel to sidle on over, and it's been smashing.</li>
<li>Oh, and I'm writing an iOS app (it's a content blocker).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="skilfulgrammar">Skilful Grammar</h2>
<p>I don't want to get into &quot;why content blocking&quot; yet, but I've wanted to play around with iOS and Swift for a while and this seemed like a great place to start. For the moment, I'm calling it Skilful Grammar: it was a dumb name a program gave me once, but I couldn't think of anything more <em>right:</em> simple keywords → useful rules.</p>
<p>It won't be &quot;press once to block ads&quot;; it won't cost anything; it might come out soon. To be frank I'm caught up on tidbits of look and feel. Building the presentation is easy; it's all the interaction fiddliness that has me hung up. That said, the app won't be a selection of switches—this will be for &quot;professionals&quot;, if you're so inclined.</p>
<p>Should you have unsolicited ramblings, second opinions, or, hell, mild interest, get in touch. I honestly don't know if the way I've gone about it stands a chance in App Review—but hey, that's all part of the fun.</p>
